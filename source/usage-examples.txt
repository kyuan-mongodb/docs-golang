Overview
--------

Usage examples provide convenient starting points for popular MongoDB
operations. Each example provides the following:

- A full Go program that to run in your own environment
- The expected result after running the program

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

These examples use the :atlas:`sample datasets <sample-data>` provided by
Atlas. You can load them into your database on the free tier of MongoDB
Atlas by following the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide <getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`
or you can
:guides:`import the sample dataset into a local MongoDB instance
</server/import/>`.

Once you have imported the dataset, you can copy and paste a usage
example into your development environment of choice. You can follow the
:doc:`quick start guide </quick-start>` to learn more about getting
started with the MongoDB Go Driver. 

Once you've copied a usage example, you'll need to edit and place your
connection string in your environment variable to get the example
connected to your instance of MongoDB. 

.. code-block:: go
   
   uri := os.Getenv("MONGODB_URI")

Environment Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use `GoDotEnv <https://github.com/joho/godotenv>`__ to set up
your environment variable. 

In your ``.env`` file at the root of your project, add the following
application configuration: 

.. code-block::

   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

.. note::

   Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.

Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :guides:`Atlas Connectivity Guide </cloud/connectionstring/>`
to enable connectivity to your instance of Atlas and find the
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` to set the
``MONGODB_URI`` environment variable in the usage example. If your instance uses
:manual:`SCRAM authentication </core/security-scram/>`, you can replace
``<user>`` with your username, ``<password>`` with your password, and
``<cluster-url>`` with the IP address or URL of your instance.

For more information about connecting to your MongoDB instance, see the
<TODO: Connection Guide>.
