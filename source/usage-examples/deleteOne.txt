Delete a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete a single document in a collection using the
``DeleteOne()`` method.

The following example specifies a query filter that matches documents in
the ``movies`` collection with the value "Twilight" in the ``title`` field, and
deletes the first document that matches. 

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/run-example-tip.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/deleteOne.go
   :start-after: begin deleteOne
   :end-before: end deleteOne
   :emphasize-lines: 2
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Expected Result
---------------

You should not be able to find the following document: 

.. code-block:: json

    { "_id": { "$oid": "573a13bff29313caabd5e06b" }, 
      ...
      "title": "Twilight",
      ...
    }

To check if you successfully deleted this document, try performing a
find operation with the ``title`` field on the collection. For an
example of how to perform the find operation, see our <TODO: Find One
Usage Example guide>.
