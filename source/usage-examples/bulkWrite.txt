=======================
Perform Bulk Operations
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can perform batch write operations on a collection using the
``BulkWrite()`` method. 

The following example specifies a slice of ``WriteModels`` and an option
to the ``BulkWrite()`` method, which performs the following in order:

- matches a document where the ``title`` field is "Record of a Shriveled Datum" and replaces it with a document that contains a different ``title`` and ``text`` field
- matches a document where the ``title`` field is "Dodging Greys" and updates that field to "Dodge The Greys"

Expected Result
---------------

After you run the preceding code snippet, you should be able to find the
document in the ``haikus`` collection: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { 
      "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
      "title" : "Dodge The Greys",
      "text" : "When there're no matches, no longer need to panic. You can use upsert."
   }

For an example on how to find a document, see our :doc:`Find
One Usage Example </usage-examples/findOne>`.
