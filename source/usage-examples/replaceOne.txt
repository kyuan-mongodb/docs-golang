==================
Replace a Document
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can replace a document in a collection by using the ``ReplaceOne()``
method. 

The following example specifies the following to the ``ReplaceOne()``
method: 

- A query filter matches documents in the ``movies`` collection where the ``title`` field is "Shrek" and replaces the first document that matches with the replacement document. 
- A replacement document contains a ``title``and ``plot`` field about the movie.

Expected Result
---------------

After you run the preceding code snippet, you should be able to find the
replacement document in the ``movies`` collection: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { 
      "_id" : ObjectId("573a139af29313caabcf224e"),
      "title" : "Shrek",
      "plot" : "After his swamp is filled with magical creatures, an ogre agrees to rescue a princess for a villainous lord in order to get his land back."
   }
