Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to remove documents from your MongoDB
collections.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform the examples in this guide, run the following snippet to load
the documents into the ``ratings`` collection of the ``tea`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/delete.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocs
   :end-before: end insertDocs

Each document contains a rating for a type of tea, which corresponds to
the ``type`` and ``rating`` fields.

Delete Operations
-----------------

Use **delete operations** to remove data from MongoDB. Delete operations
consist of the ``DeleteOne()`` and ``DeleteMany()`` functions.

Delete One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DeleteOne()`` function expects you to pass a ``Context`` type and a
query filter. The function deletes *the first document* that matches the
filter. 


Delete All Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DeleteMany()`` function expects you to pass a ``Context`` type and a
query filter. The function deletes *all* documents that match the
filter.

.. tip::

    If one document matches your filter, the ``DeleteMany()`` function
    is equivalent to the ``DeleteOne`` function.

Both functions optionally take a ``DeleteOptions`` type, which
represents options you can use to configure the function. 

Both functions also return a ``DeleteResult`` type, which contains the
number of documents deleted. If there are no matches to your filter, no
document gets deleted and ``DeleteResult`` returns ``0``.

Example
```````

The following example passes a context and a filter to the ``DeleteMany()``
function, which performs the following: 

- Matches documents where the ``ratings`` is greater than ``8``
- Specifies for the function to not send a hint and to use the default collation

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/delete.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin deleteMany
   :end-before: end deleteMany

After running the preceding example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

    Number of documents deleted: 2

.. tip::

    If the preceding example used the ``DeleteOne()`` function, the
    driver deletes the first document matched of the two.
