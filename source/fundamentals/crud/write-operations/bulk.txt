Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use **bulk operations**.

Bulk operations perform a large number of write operations. Instead of
making a call for each operation to the database, bulk operations
perform multiple operations with one call to the database.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the example in this guide, load the sample data into the
``ratings`` collection of the ``tea`` database with the following
snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insert docs
   :end-before: end insert docs

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/tea-sample-data-ending.rst

Bulk Write
----------

To perform a bulk operation, pass a slice of :ref:`WriteModel
<write-model-go>` documents to the ``BulkWrite()`` function. 

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``BulkWrite()`` function optionally takes a ``BulkWriteOptions``
type, which represents options you can use to modify its behavior. If
you don't specify a ``BulkWriteOptions``, the driver uses the default
values for each option.

The ``BulkWriteOptions`` type allows you to configure options with the
following functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()`` 
     - | Whether to allow the write to opt-out of document level validation.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetOrdered()``
     - | Whether to stop performing write operations after an error occurs. 
       | Default: ``true``

Return Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``BulkWrite()`` function returns a ``BulkWriteResult`` type, which
contains information about the bulk operation if it's successful. The
``BulkWriteResult`` type contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``InsertedCount``
     - The number of documents inserted.

   * - ``MatchedCount``
     - The number of documents matched by the :ref:`query filter <query-filter-definition-go>` in update and replace operations.

   * - ``ModifiedCount``
     - The number of documents modified by update and replace operations.

   * - ``DeletedCount``
     - The number of documents deleted.
   
   * - ``UpsertedCount`` 
     - The number of documents :ref:`upserted <upsert-definition-go>` by update and replace operations.

   * - ``UpsertedID`` 
     - The ``_id`` of the :ref:`upserted <upsert-definition-go>` documents.

.. _write-model-go:

Operations
----------

A ``WriteModel`` represents an insert, replace, update, or delete operation.

Insert
~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel`` specifying
the document you want to insert. To insert multiple documents, create an
``InsertOneModel`` for each document you want to insert.

The ``InsertOneModel`` allows you to specify its behavior with the
following function:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description

   * - ``SetDocument()`` 
     - | The document to insert.

Example
```````

This following example creates two ``InsertOneModel`` instances to
insert two documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk insert model
   :end-before: end bulk insert model

Replace
~~~~~~~

To perform a replace operation, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` specifying
the document you want to replace and a :ref:`replacement document
<replacement-document>`. To replace multiple documents, create a
``ReplaceOneModel`` for each document you want to replace.

The ``ReplaceOneModel`` allows you to specify its behavior with the
following functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

   * - ``SetFilter()`` 
     - | The :ref:`query filter <query-filter-definition-go>` specifying which document to replace.

   * - ``SetHint()`` 
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.

   * - ``SetReplacement()`` 
     - | The document to replace the matched document with.

   * - ``SetUpsert()`` 
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the :ref:`query filter <query-filter-definition-go>` doesn't match any documents.

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``ReplaceOneModel`` to replace a
document where the ``type`` is "Earl Grey" with a document where the
``type`` is "Matcha" and the ``rating`` is ``8``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk replace model
   :end-before: end bulk replace model

Update
~~~~~~

To perform an update operation, create an ``UpdateOneModel`` specifying
the document you want to update and an :ref:`update document
<update-document>`. To update multiple documents, use the
``UpdateManyModel``.

The ``UpdateOneModel`` and ``UpdateManyModel`` allow you to specify
their behavior with the following functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description

   * - ``SetArrayFilters()`` 
     - | The array elements the update applies to.

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

   * - ``SetFilter()`` 
     - | The :ref:`query filter <query-filter-definition-go>` specifying which document to update.

   * - ``SetHint()`` 
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.

   * - ``SetUpdate()`` 
     - | The modifications to apply on the matched documents.

   * - ``SetUpsert()`` 
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the :ref:`query filter <query-filter-definition-go>` doesn't match any documents.

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``UpdateOneModel`` to decrement a
documents ``rating`` by ``2`` if their ``type`` is "Masala":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk update model
   :end-before: end bulk update model

Delete
~~~~~~

To perform a delete operation, create a ``DeleteOneModel`` specifying
the document you want to delete. To delete multiple documents, use the
``DeleteManyModel``. 

The ``DeleteOneModel`` and ``DeleteManyModel`` allow you to specify
their behavior with the following functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

   * - ``SetFilter()`` 
     - | The :ref:`query filter <query-filter-definition-go>` specifying which document to delete.

   * - ``SetHint()`` 
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``DeleteManyModel`` to delete
documents where the ``rating`` is greater than ``7``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk delete model
   :end-before: end bulk delete model

Execution Order
---------------

The ``BulkWrite()`` function allows you to specify if you want to
execute the bulk operations as ordered or unordered in its
``BulkWriteOptions``. 

Ordered
~~~~~~~

By default, the ``BulkWrite()`` function executes bulk operations in
order. This means that the write operations execute in the order you
added them and stops if an error occurs.

.. tip::

   This is equivalent to specifying ``true`` in the ``SetOrdered()``
   function: 

   .. code-block:: go

      opts := options.BulkWrite().SetOrdered(true)

Unordered
~~~~~~~~~

To execute bulk write operations in any order, specify ``false`` to the
``SetOrdered()`` function. This means that all the write operations
execute and continues if an error occurs. The function reports the
errors afterwards.

Example
```````

The following example performs the following actions in any order: 

- Inserts two documents
- Replaces a document where the type is "Earl Grey" with a new document
- Increments all documents ``rating`` by ``3`` if their current rating is less than ``7``
- Deletes all documents where the rating is ``9``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin unordered
   :end-before: end unordered

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Number of documents inserted: 2
   Number of documents replaced or updated: 3
   Number of documents deleted: 2

The following documents are in the ``ratings`` collection after the bulk
operation:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type Masala} {rating 10}]
   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type Matcha} {rating 7}]
