Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to skip a specified number of returned
results from read operations. 

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following snippet to load the documents into the ``ratings``
collection of the ``tea`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/skip.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocs
   :end-before: end insertDocs

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/tea-sample-data-ending.rst

Skip
----

To skip a specified number of returned results from a query, pass the
number of documents you want to skip to the ``SetSkip()`` function of
the read operation's options.

Specify the options as the last parameter to the following read
operation functions:

- ``Find()``
- ``FindOne()``
- ``CountDocuments()``
- ``gridfs.Bucket.Find()``

If the number of documents exceeds the number of matched documents for a
query, that query returns no documents.

.. tip::

    Passing in a negative number to the ``SetSkip()`` function results
    in a runtime error.

Documents return in a natural order, which can lead to skipping random
documents. To avoid this, use a ``SetSort()`` function before the
``SetSkip()`` function.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example performs the following actions in order with the
``Find()`` function:

- An ascedning sort on the ``rating`` field
- Skips the first two documents

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/skip.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin skip
   :end-before: end skip

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false
   
   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type Oolong} {rating 7}]
   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type Earl Grey} {rating 8}]
   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type Masala} {rating 10}]

Aggregation
-----------

You can also include the :manual:`$skip </reference/operator/aggregation/skip/>`
stage to specify a skip in an aggregation pipeline.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example performs the following actions in order with the
``Aggregate()`` function:

- A descending sort on the ``rating`` field
- Skips the first three documents

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/skip.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin aggregate skip
   :end-before: end aggregate skip

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type Assam} {rating 5}]
   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type English Breakfast} {rating 5}]
