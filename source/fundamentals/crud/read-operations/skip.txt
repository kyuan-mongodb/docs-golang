Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to skip a specified number of returned
results from read operations. 

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following snippet to load the documents into the ``ratings``
collection of the ``tea`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/skip.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocs
   :end-before: end insertDocs

..include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/tea-sample-data-ending.rst

Skip
----

To skip a specified number of returned results from a query, pass the
number of documents you want to skip to the ``SetSkip()`` function of
the read operations' options.

The options you specify are the last parameter to the following read
operation functions:

- ``Find()``
- ``FindOne()``
- ``CountDocuments()``
- ``gridfs.Bucket.Find()``

If the number of documents exceeds the number of matched documents for a
query, that query returns no documents.

.. tip::

    Passing in a negative number to the ``SetSkip()`` function results
    in a runtime error.

The is no guarantee in the order of returned documents. You should
use ``SetSort()`` function before the ``SetSkip()`` function to avoid
skipping random documents.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example performs the following in order with the
``Find()`` function:

- Sorts all the matched documents in ascending order
- Skips the first two documents

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/skip.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin skip
   :end-before: end skip

.. tip:: Using Aggregation 

   You can also specify a skip in an aggregation pipeline by including
   the :manual:`$skip </reference/operator/aggregation/skip/>` stage.

   The following example specifies the same sort and skip from the
   preceding example in an aggregation pipeline:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/skip.go
      :language: go
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregate skip
      :end-before: end aggregate skip
